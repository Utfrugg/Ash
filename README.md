# Ash
This project is a side project of mine. I follow a tutorial on how to do Vulkan.
Once that is done I can evolve it into a proper renderer and then into a framework.

## Plan
These are my plans for my project:

1. Follow the tutorial until I have a mesh renderer set up
2. Organise the rendering code into an architecture
3. Expand on it until it becomes a framework
